Nathan stirred from a light nap as the train slowed. The soft blue cabin lights flickered, signalling the approaching stop. The boy stretched lazily, feeling his muscles slowly reawaken. He straight-ened his hair, which had become a bit messy during his sleep, and looked around the compartment.
It was empty, almost eerily quiet, as if the entire city had forgotten for a moment that this train existed. Apart from him, there were only a small handful of teenagers of similar age sitting, lost in their thoughts, or staring at their phones. He probably took some time off between rush hours when everyone had already gotten to their daily duties.
Nathan’s gaze met a girl’s across from him. She also wore headphones, but her eyes flickered between objects outside the window. His mind wandered about all the things she could have been thinking about, as she tightly grasped her grey backpack, pulling it tightly to her chest.
Nathan took a deep breath of cool air, hoping to steady himself, before stepping onto the platform. Even though for all he knew, it could all be just another quick stop on his journey, he was hoping for something to keep him tethered here, even for just a little while longer.
...
Nathan turned toward the door, rolling his shoulders before reaching for the handle. His palm felt too warm against the cool metal.
The hinges gave a soft creak as the door swung open.
And then, silence.
